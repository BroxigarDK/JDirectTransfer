This is the readme for the JDirectTransfer project.

Requirements:
Java Runtime Enviroment 1.6 or above

Purpose: 
To easy the process of transfering one or multiple files between two computers on the internet, without using servers or uploading sites such as Rapidshare.com or MegaUpload.com 

How it works:
Upon launch, the program establishes a ServerSocket that accepts incomming connections on port 4444 (May be changed in the future)
The program is set up with a unique id (email-adress) and a recovery password the first time it is used. This is stored in a database at www.alsa-data.dk
The program generates a randomized 8-ciffer password each time it is launched. This is not stored anywhere.

When an incomming connection connects to the ServerSocket, an integer is parsed to the program from the remote user, and is being compared to the generated password.
* If the two integers doesn't compare, the connection is dropped
* If the two integers are the same, the connection is accepted and awaits the further process.

When the connection has been accepted, the server sends a signal back to the client that it has been accepted. From here on, the client will send:
* Filename(s)
* File size(s)

After this, the Server will go into a state of receiving files, and the client will send a start signal with name and size, send the file bytewise and then send a terminal signal.
The server then stores the file in the default download-folder on the server and sends an all-clear signal  on which the client sends the next file, or terminates the connection.
